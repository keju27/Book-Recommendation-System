# Book Recommendation System


A simple yet effective book recommendation engine written in python using Jupyter notebook and Pandas library.

The engine generates either random book names or proper recommendations for you based on certain ratings given by you.


## Working



The program uses a .csv file as a database for over 45,000+ books (presently) in order to fetch recommendations for you.
